# Simple Calculator Web App

This is a basic calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

* **Clear Display:** Shows the current input and results.
* **Number Input:** Allows entering numbers using the on-screen buttons.
* **Decimal Input:** Enables entering decimal numbers.
* **Basic Operations:** Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).
* **Clear Function:** Resets the calculator to its initial state.
* **Change Sign:** Toggles the sign of the current number.
* **Error Handling:** Prevents division by zero and displays an error message.
* **Responsive Design:** Layout adapts to different screen sizes (though primarily designed for desktop).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML (`index.html`):** Structures the content and layout of the calculator.
* **CSS (`style.css`):** Styles the appearance of the calculator, making it visually appealing.
* **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Handles the calculator's logic and functionality, responding to user interactions.

## How to Use

1.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.** You can do this by double-clicking the file or by opening it through your browser's "Open File" option.
2.  **Use the buttons on the calculator to perform calculations:**
    * Click the number buttons (0-9) to enter numbers.
    * Click the "." button to enter a decimal point.
    * Click the operator buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) to select an operation.
    * Click the "=" button to see the result.
    * Click the "C" button to clear the display and reset the calculator.
    * Click the "+/-" button to change the sign of the current number.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the calculator.
* `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the calculator's appearance.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic and functionality of the calculator.

## Getting Started (Development)

If you want to modify or contribute to this project:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you have it in one) or simply have the three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) in the same directory.
2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser** to see the calculator.
3.  **Edit the `style.css` file** to change the appearance.
4.  **Edit the `script.js` file** to modify the calculator's functionality.
5.  **Make changes to the `index.html`** to adjust the structure or add more features.

## Further Enhancements

Here are some ideas for potential improvements:

* **Memory Functions (M+, M-, MR, MC):** Add memory storage and recall capabilities.
* **More Advanced Operations:** Implement functions like square root, percentage, exponents, etc.
* **Improved Error Handling:** Provide more informative error messages.
* **Better Responsiveness:** Ensure the calculator looks and works well on various screen sizes (tablets, mobile devices).
* **Keyboard Support:** Allow users to input numbers and operations using their keyboard.
* **Calculation History:** Display a history of previous calculations.
